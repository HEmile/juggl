These plugins work especially well together with [[Juggl]], and are taken into account while designing Juggl to ensure they are compatible.

- **Breadcrumbs**: [[Breadcrumbs integration|Tightly integrated]] with Juggl using a custom view. Can render its hierarchies within [[Juggl]] using [[Breadcrumbs code blocks]]
- **Supercharged links**: Can be used to mimic the styling of links such that they have the same color as the juggl nodes. ![[Pasted image 20220127142903.png]]
- **Pane Relief**: Pane-based history is very useful when you use Juggl in the [[Workspace mode]] next to a markdown view.
