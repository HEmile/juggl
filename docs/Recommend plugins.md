These plugins work especially well together with [[Juggl]], and are kept in mind while developing Juggl to ensure compatibility.

- **[Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/)**: [[Breadcrumbs integration|Tightly integrated]] with Juggl using a custom view. Can render its hierarchies within [[Juggl]] using [[Breadcrumbs code blocks]]

- **[Supercharged links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links)**: Can be used to mimic the styling of links such that they have the same color as the juggl nodes. 
- **[Pane Relief](https://github.com/pjeby/pane-relief)**: Pane-based history is very useful when you use Juggl in the [[Workspace mode]] next to a markdown view.
- **[Hover editor](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor)**: Allows editing notes right from within Juggl by hovering over nodes.
