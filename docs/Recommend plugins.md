These plugins work especially well together with [[Juggl]], and are taken into account while designing Juggl to ensure they are compatible.

- **[Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/)**: [[Breadcrumbs integration|Tightly integrated]] with Juggl using a custom view. Can render its hierarchies within [[Juggl]] using [[Breadcrumbs code blocks]]

- **[Supercharged links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links)**: Can be used to mimic the styling of links such that they have the same color as the juggl nodes. 
- **[Pane Relief](https://github.com/pjeby/pane-relief)**: Pane-based history is very useful when you use Juggl in the [[Workspace mode]] next to a markdown view.
