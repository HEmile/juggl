As part of the [[Breadcrumbs integration]], you can use code blocks for querying in the Breadcrumbs plugin can visualize the results using [[Juggl]]! See this guide for more information https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/wiki/Codeblocks . 

These code blocks support the same options as [[Juggl code block]]s:
