Juggl is tightly integrated with the [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs) plugin! If you have Breadcrumbs installed, it will add all its edges to your Juggl graphs using [[Link Types]]. This can be used to incorporate the Dataview inline attributes syntax, such as `hasTopic:: [[artificial intelligence]]`. 

You can visualize the *up* and down *hierarchies* using the [Juggl View](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/wiki/Views#juggl-view). It uses a custom [[Layouts|hierarchical layout]] for the best insight. See [the Breadcrumbs wiki for documentation](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/wiki/Views#juggl-view).

Custom hierarchy visualizations can also be created using [[Breadcrumbs code blocks]].
