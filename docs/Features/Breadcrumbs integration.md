Juggl is tightly integrated with the [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs) plugin! You can visualize the *up* and down *hierarchies* using the [Juggl View](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/wiki/Views#juggl-view). It uses a custom [[Layouts|hierarchical layout]] for the best insight. See [the Breadcrumbs wiki for documentation](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/wiki/Views#juggl-view).

Custom hierarchy visualizations can also be created using [[Breadcrumbs code blocks]].
